  <p class="texts">"Children learn as they play. Most importantly, in play, children learn how to learn".
    <br>
    - O. Fred Donaldson
    <br>
    <br>
    Young children learn via experience. Let them have fun and find ways in which they can engage in the learning process through a variety of activities. It's not until they're a little bit older that they will be ready to begin learning by simply listening to and observing their teachers.
